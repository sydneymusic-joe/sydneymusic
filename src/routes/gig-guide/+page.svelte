					This guide is as simple as we can practically get away with. We’ll include some occasional
					commentary (feel free to submit your own!) to help give you context on what can be a
					dizzyingly complex network of musicians, collectives, communities, and spaces, or just
					make sure you don’t miss out on catching your next favourite act.

					<span class="font-bold text-sm">Artists, managers, promoters, and venues:</span><br />
					Self-promo is fine — we love it when you let us know what you’ve got going on! But we won’t
					publish your marketing/social copy verbatim or give you special consideration in the guide.
					We generally don’t list cover/tribute bands or background-music sets at hospitality venues.
					All listings are at our own discretion. We will also graciously refuse any offer of door spots
					for shows where we can buy tickets.

				<div class="prose prose-sm">
					<p>
						This guide is as simple as we can practically get away with. We’ll include some
						occasional commentary (feel free to submit your own!) to help give you context on what
						can be a dizzyingly complex network of musicians, collectives, communities, and spaces,
						or just make sure you don’t miss out on catching your next favourite act.
					</p>

						Got a gig you think should be listed here? <a href="mailto:contact@sydneymusic.net"
							>Drop us an email</a
						>.

				<div class="prose prose-sm">
					<p>
						<span class="font-bold text-sm">Artists, managers, promoters, and venues:</span><br />
						Self-promo is fine —we love it when you let us know what you’ve got going on! But we won’t
						publish your marketing/social copy verbatim or give you special consideration in the guide.
						We generally don’t list cover/tribute bands or background-music sets at hospitality venues.
						All listings are at our own discretion. We will also graciously refuse any offer of door
						spots for shows where we can buy tickets.
